use _ :Test;
plan 2;

my $test-md = q:to/§md/;
    # Test markdown file

    Some content. And some more.  And then,
    maybe, an example:

    ```raku
       say 5 + 37;    # OUTPUT: «42»
       say 'snafu'.uc # OUTPUT: «SNAFU»
    ```

    See how that worked? the text after the example asks.

    If not, maybe this example will help?
    ```raku
    sub no-output($a) { "this function isn't called"}
    ```

    See what I mean?
